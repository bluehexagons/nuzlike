# Nuzlike

This began as a game idea, and ended as another tech demo. It was
going to be a monster catching game with permadeath.

# Controls

WASD - move

E - interact


# Features

This is a from-scratch sprite-based engine built in Canvas2D,
supporting animations and layering. It uses basic optimization
strategies to selectively repaint changed portions of the screen.

There is a prototype of a simple dialog system allowing multiple choices,
and the ability to cut small trees to pass through them.


# Artwork

Uses free artwork from hyptosis, according to the file names.
It may have been this set:

The graphics were intended to be replaced, so I don't have a record
of what I used.

Some other images in this repo were created by Ugvts for another project
of mine, and are licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA.
