# Nuzlike

This began as a game idea, and ended as another tech demo. It was
going to be a monster catching game with permadeath.

# Controls

WASD - move

E - interact


# Features

This is a from-scratch sprite-based engine built in Canvas2D,
supporting animations and layering. It uses basic optimization
strategies to selectively repaint changed portions of the screen.

There is a prototype of a simple dialog system allowing multiple choices,
and the ability to cut small trees to pass through them.

bash.ts is a from-scratch bash interpreter I built for another project
and tried to shoehorn into this codebase.
